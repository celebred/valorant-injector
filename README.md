# 🔗 Usermode Valorant Injector via SetWindowHookEx

A modern fork and enhancement of the popular *hookloader* originally by DrNseven — this injector targets **VALORANT** using a fully usermode approach with `SetWindowHookEx`, enabling stealthy DLL injection without any kernel drivers or vulnerable mappings.

While many current P2Cs still rely on the original hookloader base, one key issue persists: **DLLs must be written to disk**, making them trivial to extract. This version addresses that and more.
